A random geometric graph \(G_n\) is constructed by taking vertices \(X_1, \dots, X_n \in {\mathbb R}^d\) at random (i.i.d. according to some probability distribution \(\nu\) 
with a bounded density function) and including an edge between \(X_i\) and 
\(X_j\) if \(|Xi ‚àí Xj| < r\) where \(r = r(n) > 0\). 
We prove a conjecture of Penrose stating that when \(r = r(n)\) is chosen such that 
\(nr^d = o(\ln n)\) then the probability distribution of the clique number \(\omega(G_n)\) becomes concentrated on two consecutive integers and we show that the same holds for a number of other graph parameters including the chromatic number \(\chi(G_n)\). </div>

The circular choosability or circular list chromatic number of a graph is a list-version of the circular chromatic number, introduced by Mohar and studied by several other groups of authors. One of the nice properties that the circular chromatic number enjoys is that it is a rational number for all finite graphs G, and a fundamental question, posed by Zhu and reiterated by several others, is whether the same holds for the circular choosability. In this paper we show that this is indeed the case.

A proper edge-colouring with the property that every cycle contains edges of at least three distinct colours is called an acyclic edge-colouring. The acyclic chromatic index of a graph \(G\), denoted \(\chi_a'(G)\), is the minimum k such that G admits an acyclic edge-colouring with k colours. We conjecture that if \(G\) is planar and \(\Delta(G)\) is large enough then \(\chi_a'(G) = \Delta(G)\). 
We settle this conjecture for planar graphs with girth at least 5.

We consider the conic feasibility problem associated with the linear homogeneous system 
\(Ax \leq 0, x\neq 0\). The complexity of iterative algorithms for solving this problem depends on a condition number \({\cal C}(A)\). When studying the typical behaviour of algorithms under stochastic input one is therefore naturally led to investigate the fatness of the tails of the distribution of \({\cal C}(A)\). Introducing the very general class of uniformly absolutely continuous probability models for the random matrix \(A\), we show that the distribution tails of \({\cal C}(A)\) decrease at algebraic rates, both for the Goffin-Cheung-Cucker number \({\cal C}_G\) and the Renegar number \({\cal C}_R\). The exponent that drives the decay arises naturally in the theory of uniform absolute continuity, which we also develop in this paper. In the case of CG we also discuss lower bounds on the tail probabilities and show that there exist absolutely continuous input models for which the tail decay is subalgebraic.

Given a graph \(G = (V,E)\), let \(P\) be a partition of \(V\).

We say that \(P\) is acyclic if for any parts \(P,P‚Ä≤\) of \(P\), the bipartite subgraph \(G[P,P‚Ä≤]\) consisting of the edges between \(P\) and \(P‚Ä≤\) in \(P\) contains no cycles. The acyclic dominating number \(\text{ad}(G)\) of \(G\) is the least number of parts in any partition of \(V\) that is both acyclic and dominating; and we shall denote by \(\text{ad}(d)\) the maximum over all graphs \(G\) of maximum degree at most \(d\)

We propose a coloring algorithm for sparse random graphs generated by the geographical thresholdgraph (GTG) model, a generalization of random geometric graphs (RGG). In a GTG, nodes are distributed in a Euclidean space, and edges are assigned according to a threshold function involving the distance between nodes as well as randomly chosen node weights. The motivation for analyzing thismodel is that many real networks (e.g., wireless networks, the Internet, etc.) need to be studied by usinga ‚Äúricher‚Äù stochastic model (which in this case includes both a distance between nodes and weights on thenodes). Here, we analyze the GTG coloring algorithm together with the graph‚Äôs clique number, showingformally that in spite of the differences in structure between GTG and RGG, the asymptotic behaviorof the chromatic number is identical: \(\chi = \ln n (1 + ùëú(1))\). Finally, we consider the leading corrections \(\ln\ln n\) to this expression, again using the coloring algorithm and clique number to provide bounds on the chromatic number. We show that the gap between the lower and upper bound is within \(C \ln n / (\ln \ln n)^2\), and specify the constant \(C\).

We model a problem about networks built from wireless devices using identifying andlocating-dominating codes in unit disk graphs. It is known that minimising the size ofan identifying code is NP-complete even for bipartite graphs. First, we improve thisresult by showing that the problem remains NP-complete for bipartite planar unitdisk graphs. Then, we address the question of the existence of an identifying code forrandom unit disk graphs. We derive the probability that there exists an identifyingcode as a function of the radius of the disks and we find that for all interestingranges of r this probability is bounded away from one. The results obtained arein sharp contrast with those concerning random graphs in the Erd&ouml;s-R&eacute;nyi model.Another well-studied class of codes are locating-dominating codes, which are lessdemanding than identifying codes. A locating-dominating code always exists, butminimising its size is still NP-complete in general. We extend this result to oursetting by showing that this question remains NP-complete for arbitrary planar unitdisk graphs. Finally, we study the minimum size of such a code in random unit diskgraphs, and we prove that with probability tending to one, it is of size \((\frac{n}{r})^{2/3+o(1)}\)if \(r\) is chosen such that \(nr^2 \to \infty\) and of size \(n^{1+o(1)}\) if \(nr^2 \ll \ln n\).

We consider the standard random geometric graph process in which \(n\) vertices are placed at random on the unit square and edges are sequentially added in increasing order of edge-length.

Given independent random points \(X_1, \dots, X_n \in {\mathbb R}^d\) with common probabilitydistribution \(\nu\), and a positive distance \(r = r(n) > 0\), we construct a random geometricgraph \(G_n\) with vertex set \(\{1, . . . , n\}\) where distinct \(i\) and \(j\) are adjacent when \(|X_i ‚àíX_j| \leq r\). Here \(|.|\) may be any norm on \({\mathbb R}^d\), and \(\nu\) may be any probability distributionon \({\mathbb R}^d\) with a bounded density function. 
We consider the chromatic number \(\chi(G_n)\)of \(G_n\) and its relation to the clique number \(\omega(G_n)\) as \(n \to \infty\). 
Both McDiarmid and Penrose considered the range of \(r\) when 
\(r \ll (\frac{\ln n}{n})^{1/d}\) and the range when \(n\)\(r \gg (\frac{\ln n}{n})^{1/d}\), and their results showed a dramatic difference between these two cases. Here we sharpen and extend the earlier results, and in particular we consider the ‚Äòphase change‚Äô range when \(r \sim (\frac{t \ln n}{n} )^{1/d}\) with \(t > 0\) a fixed constant. Both McDiarmidand Penrose asked for the behaviour of the chromatic number in this range. 
We determine constants \(c(t)\) such that \(\frac{\chi(G_n)}{n r^d} \to c(t)\) almost surely. 
Further, we find a ‚Äúsharp threshold‚Äù (except for less interesting choices of the norm when the unit ball tiles \(d\)-space): there is a constant \(t_0 > 0\) such that if \(t \leq t_0\) then \(\frac{\chi(G_n)}{\omega(G_n)}\) tends to 1 almost surely, but if \(t > t_0\) then \(\chi(G_n)\) tends to a limit > 1 almost surely.

A collection of sets \(\cal F\) has the \((p,q)\)-property if out of every \(p\) elements of \(\cal F\) there are \(q\) that have a point in common. A transversal of a collection of sets \(\cal F\) is a set \(A\) that intersects every member of \(\cal F\). Gr&uuml;nbaum conjectured that every family \(\cal F\) of closed, convex sets in the plane with the \((4, 3)\)-property and at least two elements that are compact has a transversal of bounded cardinality. Here we construct a counterexample to his conjecture. On the positive side, we also show that if such a collection \(\cal F\) contains two disjoint compacta then there is a transveral of cardinality at most 13.

An arrangement of pseudocircles is a finite collection of Jordan curves in the plane with the additional properties that (i) every two curves meet in at most two points; and (ii) if two curves meet in a point \(p\), then they cross at \(p\).We say that two arrangements \({\cal C} = (c_1,\dots,c_n)\) and \({\cal D} = (d_1,\dots,d_n)\) are equivalent if there is a homeomorphism \(\varphi\) of the plane onto itself such that \(\varphi[c_i] = d_i\) for all \(i \in \{1, \dots , n\}\). Linhart and Ortner (2005) gave an example of an arrangement of five pseudocircles that is not equivalent to an arrangement of circles, and they conjectured that every arrangement of at most four pseudocircles is equivalent to an arrangement of circles. Here we prove their conjecture.We consider two related recognition problems. The first is the problem of deciding, given a (combinatorial description of a) pseudocircle arrangement, whether it is equivalent to an arrangement of circles. The second is deciding whether it is equivalent to an arrangement of convex pseudocircles. We prove that both problems are NP-hard, answering questions of Bultena, Gr&uuml;nbaum and Ruskey (1998) and of Linhart and Ortner (2008).We also give an example of an arrangement of convex pseudocircles with the property that its intersection graph (i.e. the graph with one vertex for each pseudocircle and an edge between two vertices if and only if the corresponding pseudocircles intersect) cannot be realised as the intersection graph of a family of circles. This disproves a folklore conjecture communicated to us by Pyatkin.

<div class="full-article">
We study the Maker-Breaker \(k\)-clique game played on the edge set of the random graph \(G(n,p)\). In this game, two players, Maker and Breaker, alternately claim unclaimed edges of \(G(n, p)\), until all the edges are claimed. Maker wins if he claims all the edges of a \(k\)-clique; Breaker wins otherwise. We determine that the thresholdfor the graph property that Maker can win this game is at \(n^{‚àí2/(k+1)}\), for all 
\(k > 3\), thus proving a conjecture of Stojakovic and Szabo. 
More precisely, we conclude that there existconstants \(c, C > 0\) such that when \(p > C n^{‚àí2/(k+1)}\) the game is Maker‚Äôs win a.a.s., and when \(p < cn^{‚àí2/(k+1)}\) it is Breaker‚Äôs win a.a.s.For the triangle game, when \(k = 3\), we give a more precise result, describing the hitting time of Maker‚Äôs win in the random graph process. We show that, with high probability, Maker can win the triangle game exactly at the time when a copy of \(K_5\) with one edge removed appears in the random graph process. As a consequence, we are able to give an expression for the limiting probability of Maker‚Äôs win in the triangle game played on the edge set of \(G(n, p)\).

In a Maker-Breaker game on a graph \(G\), Breaker and Maker alternately claim edges of \(G\). Maker wins if, after all edges have been claimed, the graph induced by his edges has some desired property. We consider four Maker-Breaker games played on random geometric graphs. For each of our four games we show that if we add edges between \(n\) points chosen uniformly at random in the unit square by order of increasing edge-length then, with probability tending to one as \(n\to\infty\), the graph becomes Maker-win the very moment it satisfies a simple necessary condition. In particular, with high probability, Maker wins the connectivity game as soon as the minimum degree is at least two; Maker wins the Hamilton cycle game as soon as the minimum degree is at least four; Maker wins the perfect matching game as soon as the minimum degree is at least two and every edge has at least three neighbouring vertices; and Maker wins the H-game as soon as there is a subgraph from a finite list of ‚Äúminimal graphs‚Äù. These results also allow us to give precise expressions for the limiting probability that \(G(n, r)\) is Maker-win in each case, where \(G(n, r)\) is the graph on n points chosen uniformly at random on the unit square with an edge between two points if and only if their distance is at most \(r\).

An \(r\)-dynamic \(k\)-coloring of a graph G is a proper \(k\)-coloring of \(G\) such that every vertex in \(V(G)\) has neighbors in at least \(\min\{d(v),r\}\) different color classes. The \(r\)-dynamic chromatic number of a graph \(G\), written \(\chi_r(G)\), is the least \(k\) such that \(G\) has such a coloring. Proving a conjecture of Jahanbekam, Kim, O, and West, we show that the \(m\)-by-\(n\) grid has no 3-dynamic 4-coloring when 
\(mn \equiv 2 \text{mod} 4\). This completes the determination of the \(r\)-dynamic chromatic number of the \(m\)-by-\(n\) grid for all \(r,m,n\).

We consider a model for complex networks that was introduced by Krioukov et al. In this model, \(N\) points are chosen randomly inside a disk on the hyperbolic plane and any two of them are joined by an edge if they are within a certain hyperbolic distance. The N points are distributed according to a quasi-uniform distribution, which is a distorted version of the uniform distribution. The model turns out to behave similarly to the well- known Chung-Lu model, but without the independence between the edges. Namely, it exhibits a power-law degree sequence and small distances but, unlike the Chung-Lu model and many other well-known models for complex networks, it also exhibits clustering.The model is controlled by two parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\nu\) where, roughly speaking, Œ± controls the exponent of the power-law and ŒΩ controls the average degree. The present paper focuses on the evolution of the component structure of the random graph. We show that (a) for \(\alpha>1\) and \(\nu\) arbitrary, with high probability, as the number of vertices grows, the largest component of the random graph has sublinear order; (b) for \(\alpha < 1\) and \(\nu\) arbitrary with high probability there is a ‚Äúgiant‚Äù component of linear order, and (c) when \(\alpha=1\) then there is a non-trivial phase transition for the existence of a linear-sized component in terms of \(\nu\).

In this paper, we study the vertex pursuit game of Cops and Robbers, in which cops try to capture a robber on the vertices of a graph.

Two vertices are adjacent with probability \(p\) if the Euclidean distance between them is at most \(r\). If the distance is bigger then \(r\) then they are never adjacent.

The random geometric graph is obtained by sampling \(n\) points from the unit square (uniformly at random and independently), and connecting two points whenever their distance is at most \(r\), for some given \(r = r(n)\). We consider the following variation on the random geometric graph: in each of \(n\) rounds in total, a player is offered two random points from the unit square, and has to select exactly one of these two points for inclusion in the evolving geometric graph.We study the problem of avoiding a linear-sized (or ‚Äúgiant‚Äù) component in this setting. Specifically, we show that for any \(r \ll (n \log \log n)^{‚àí1/3}\) there is a strategy that succeeds with high probability in keeping all component sizes sublinear. We also show that this is tight in the following sense: for any \(r \gg (n \log \log n)^{‚àí1/3}\) , with high probabiliy the player will be forced to create a component of size \((1 ‚àí o(1))n\), no matter how he plays. We also prove that the corresponding offline problem exhibits a similar threshold behavior at \(r(n) = \Theta(n^{‚àí1/3})\).These findings should be compared to the existing results for the (ordinary) random geometric graph: there a giant component arises with high probability once \(r\) is of order \(n^{‚àí1/2}\). Thus our results show, in particular, that in the geometric setting the power of choices can be exploited to a much larger extent than in the classical Erd&ouml;s-R&eacute;nyi random graph, where the appearance of a giant component can only be delayed by a constant factor.

In this paper, we consider the treewidth of two related random graph models.
The first one is the random geometric graph, where we drop \(n\) points onto

The second one is the percolated grid, in which we take a \(k\times k\)-grid and keep each edge with probability \(p\), independently of all other edges. 
We show that, with probability tending to one as \(k \to \infty\), the treewidth of the percolated grid is \(\Theta( k )\) if
\(p>1/2\) and \(\Theta( \sqrt{\log k} )\) if \(p < 1/2\).
By reusing part of the proof of this last result, we also prove a conjecture of Mitsche and Perarnau stating that,

Let \(\cal G\) be an addable, minor-closed class of graphs. We prove that the zero-one law holds in monadic second-order logic (MSO) for the random graph drawn uniformly at random from all connected graphs in \(G\) on \(n\) vertices, and the convergence law in MSO holds if we draw uniformly at random from all graphs in \(G\) on \(n\) vertices. We also prove analogues of these results for the class of graphs embeddable on a fixed surface, provided we restrict attention to first order logic (FO). Moreover, the limiting probability that a given FO sentence is satisfied is independent of the surface \(S\). We also prove that the closure of the set of limiting probabilities is always the finite union of at least two disjoint intervals, and that it is the same for FO and MSO. For the classes of forests and planar graphs we are able to determine the closure of the set of limiting probabilities precisely. For planar graphs it consists of exactly 108 intervals, each of length \(\approx 5 ¬∑ 10^{‚àí6}\). Finally, we analyse examples of non-addable classes where the behaviour is quite different. For instance, the zero-one law does not hold for the random caterpillar on \(n\) vertices, even in FO.

That is, if \(p > 1/2\) then a.s. there is an unbounded curve in the plane all of whose points are black; while if \(p \leq 1/2\) then a.s. all connected components of the set of black points are bounded.

We consider the component structure of a recent model of random graphs on the
hyperbolic plane that was introduced by Krioukov et al. The model exhibits a
power law degree sequence, small distances and clustering, features that are
associated with the so-called complex networks. The model is controlled by two
parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\nu\) where, roughly speaking, \(\alpha\) controls the
exponent of the power law and \(\nu\) controls the average degree. Refining
earlier results, we are able to show a law of large numbers for the largest
component. That is, we show that the fraction of points in the largest
component tends in probability to a constant \(c\) that depends only on
\(\alpha,\nu\), while all other components are sublinear. We also study how \(c\)
depends on \(\alpha, \nu\). To deduce our results, we introduce a local
approximation of the random graph by a continuum percolation model on
\(\mathbb{R}^2\) that may be of independent interest.
