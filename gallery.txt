Some of my research projects lend themselves  well to computer experiments. 
Here are some visualizations I did for various talks and papers.

<b>Confetti percolation</b>

<p>The confetti percolation process, sometimes also called the coloured dead leaves process, is defined as follows.
Disks of radius one arrive onto the plane according to a constant intensity space-time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_process">Poisson process</a>. The disks are coloured either black, with probability \(p\), or white, with probability \(1-p\).
Each point of the plane assumes the colour of the first disk that lands on it.
You can think of this as the situation where confetti disks are "raining" onto a glass plate and you are looking up from underneath the glass at the pattern you see. 
Alternatively, you can think of disks having rained onto the ground for a very long time. Then the "confetti rain" suddenly stops and we examine the pattern that we see on the ground. <br>
Here are simulations corresponding to \(p=\frac14,\frac12,\frac34\), where the 
pattern inside a \(200\times200\) square is shown. </p>

In 1998, Benjamini and Schramm wanted to know for which 
values of \(p\) there will exist an unbounded curve all of whose points are black. 
In particular they asked whether this would be the case if and only if \(p>1/2\). <br>
In a recent paper (number 35 in my list of publications above), I proved that this is indeed the case.

<b>Random geometric graphs</b>

<p>
In the most general formulation, a random geometric graph is what you get if you take 
a random set of points in some metric space and you join pairs of points depending on some rule (which may include additional randomness).
A special case is the <em>Gilbert model</em> where we take \(n\) points uniformly at random in the square (or \(d\)-dimensional hypercube) and connect two points if the distance is less than \(r\).
The model is named after E.N. Gilbert who defined a very similar model in 1961. <br>

Here is a simulation with \(n=500\) points and \(r=.03, .06, .09\).

<p>In my previous work I have amongst other things considered the chromatic number of and Hamilton cycles in random geometric graphs.

<b>Voronoi percolation on the hyperbolic plane</b>


<p>The Voronoi percolation model is defined as follows.
We start with a Poisson process \({\cal P}\) of constant intensity on the plane.
To each point \(x\in{\cal P}\) we assign a <em>Voronoi cell</em> \(C(x)\), the set of all points that are closer to \(x\) than to any other point of \(\cal P\). 
Finally, for each Voronoi cell we flip a coin to colour it either black (blue in the picture below), with probability \(p\), or white, with probability \(1-p\). 
A pertinent question again is for which values of \(p\) there will be unbounded black curves. Or, in other words, when is there an infinite, non-repeating sequence of black Voronoi cells, each touching the next one in the sequence? <br>
In 2006 Bollob&aacute;s and Riordan showed that this is so if and only if \(p>1/2\).
Earlier, Benjamini and Schramm had already considered the situation where instead of on the ordinary, Euclidean plane, we define the Voronoi percolation model on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry">hyperbolic plane</a>.
Their results highlight a number of striking differences with the Euclidean case, and they also pose a number of tantalizing questions that are open to this day. <br>
Here is a computer simulation of the hyperbolic Voronoi model
with \(p=1/2\) and intensity \(\lambda=1\), shown in the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincaré_disk_model">Poincar&eacute; disk representation</a> of the hyperbolic plane.

(If you happen to wear XXL then you are welcome to collect a free t-shirt in my office.)<br>
Here is another simulation of hyperbolic Voronoi percolation, now shown in the

<b>Hyperbolic Gilbert model</b>



<p>In the (original, infinite) Gilbert model, we take a Poisson process \({\cal P}\) on the plane, and we create a graph by joining any two points by an edge that have distance less than \(r\).
This of course also makes sense in the hyperbolic plane.
Here is a computer simulation, with \(r=1\) and intensity \(\lambda=5\) 
of the Poisson process, shown on the left in Poincar&eacute disk representation
and on the right in the native representation.

<b>The KPKVB model</b>


<p>
A different way of generating a random graph in hyperbolic space was introduced 
recently by Krioukov-Papadopoulos-Kitsak-Vahdat-Bogu&ntilde;&aacute;.
Perhaps rather surprisingly, this random graph model has features that are 
usually attributed to complex networks, including a power law degree distribution and clustering.
Besides the number of nodes, the model has two parameters, \(\alpha\) and \(\nu\). Roughly speaking \(\alpha\) controls  the exponent of the powerlaw and \(\nu\) controls the average degree.
For a more detailed definition of the model see my papers with Bode and Fountoulakis above. <br>
Here are computer simulations corresponding to 5000 nodes with \(\alpha=.9,\nu=.2\) (left) and  \(\alpha=.51,\nu=.2\) (right), shown in the native model of the hyperbolic plane.

<p>Together with Michel Bode and <a href="http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/N.Fountoulakis/">Nikolaos Fountoulakis</a> I recently wrote two papers on this model.
One on the emergence of a "giant" component, and one on the transition from a 
disconnected to a connected graph.
Especially in the latter work we observed behaviour that is different from all other random graph models in the literature as far as we are aware.
